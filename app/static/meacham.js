In 1869 the stable was enlarged and made to face north rather than east to Main Street, and the road was opened all the way to School Street; the lane became known as a street in 1877 when the Town extended it as far as Maple Street at the time the new school built. Owners of houses along Prospect Street named it that rather than Allen, though it continues the street to the west."

Michael Pool seating 1500 and 2100 in 1962-3,29 also in 1972 when the two-story women’s locker room added to southeast corner.30 Other remodelings occurred in 1974, 1980, and 1989.31 The windows along the main rooms were bricked over after 1961. Dolphin benches in upper halls outside the offices came from Spaulding Pool."
